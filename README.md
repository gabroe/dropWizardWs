# Introduction

This example application was developed to provide a template of the use of DropWizard with self documented web services.

# Overview

The project contains a small set of resources that can be used as an starting project of how to create Java REST web services. Some of the tools used for this application are:

-[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

-[Dropwizard](http://gunshowcomic.com/comics/20100528.gif) pulls together stable, mature libraries from the Java ecosystem into a simple, light-weight package that lets you focus on getting things done, [getting started](http://www.dropwizard.io/getting-started.html).

-[Jersey](https://jersey.java.net/) framework that implements the JAX-RS reference, it provides its own [API](https://jersey.java.net/apidocs/latest/jersey/index.html) that allows easy implementation of RESTful services, included with DropWizard.

-[Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/), bundled with DropWizard it provides a web server and javax.servlet container that is packed with the application so no need of running apache or any other web container for this example.

-[Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson), In terms of data formats, JSON has become the webâ€™s lingua franca, and Jackson is the king of JSON on the JVM. In addition to being lightning fast, it has a sophisticated object mapper, allowing you to export your domain models directly.

-[Swagger](http://swagger.io/), Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of the RESTful API. With the largest ecosystem of API tooling on the planet, thousands of developers are supporting Swagger in almost every modern programming language and deployment environment. With a Swagger-enabled API, you get interactive documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability.

# Running The Application

* To package the example run.

	mvn package


* To run the server run.

	java -jar target/dropwizard-example-0.0.1.jar server config.yml


* To hit the Hello World example (hit refresh a few times).

	http://localhost:8080/hello-world
	
	
* To see the web services docs (Created using Swagger)

	http://localhost:8080/docs/


* To create an eclipse proyect using this as the source, run:

	mvn eclipse:eclipse

	
* Other maven useful commands are:
 
	mvn clean
	mvn compile
	mvn eclipse:clean
	

The application is built using Maven, we are going to assume that it was already installed and configured, some of the jar files might not be in the cvent nexus repository, if so update your ~/.m2/settings.xml configuration and remove the cvent mirror, To test the example application run the following commands.	

# Adding a new web service

Edit the [YAML file](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml/yaml_format.html) /config.yml and add a new resource FQCN, remember that it is very important to use the JERSEY annotations and the Swagger ones to be able to use the service and to browse it on the swagger documentation (see TestResource.java as an example)
